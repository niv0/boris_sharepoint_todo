# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables automatic creation of Microsoft Teams todo items based on content from a specific SharePoint site. The tool will monitor or read designated SharePoint content and convert relevant items into actionable todos within Microsoft Teams, streamlining workflow management across Microsoft 365 platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to automatically convert SharePoint list items into Teams todos, so that I can manage my tasks in one centralized location without manual copying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a SharePoint list item is marked with a specific status THEN the system SHALL create a corresponding todo in Microsoft Teams
2. WHEN a SharePoint list item contains due date information THEN the system SHALL set the same due date on the Teams todo
3. WHEN a SharePoint list item has assigned users THEN the system SHALL assign the Teams todo to the same users
4. IF a SharePoint list item is updated THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding Teams todo with the new information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to configure which SharePoint site and lists to monitor, so that I can control which content gets converted to Teams todos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the tool THEN the system SHALL allow specification of SharePoint site URL
2. WHEN configuring the tool THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific SharePoint lists to monitor
3. WHEN configuring the tool THEN the system SHALL allow mapping of SharePoint fields to Teams todo properties
4. IF invalid SharePoint credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with both SharePoint and Teams securely, so that the tool can access my data without compromising security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL use OAuth 2.0 for both SharePoint and Teams authentication
2. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
4. IF the user lacks permissions THEN the system SHALL display appropriate permission error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to avoid duplicate todos being created, so that my Teams todo list remains clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a SharePoint item has already been converted THEN the system SHALL NOT create duplicate Teams todos
2. WHEN a SharePoint item is deleted THEN the system SHALL optionally remove the corresponding Teams todo
3. WHEN the tool runs multiple times THEN the system SHALL only process new or updated SharePoint items
4. IF a Teams todo is manually deleted THEN the system SHALL respect that deletion and not recreate it

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor the tool's operation and handle errors gracefully, so that I can ensure reliable operation and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool processes SharePoint items THEN the system SHALL log all operations with timestamps
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
3. WHEN API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with backoff
4. IF network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL queue operations for retry when connectivity is restored
